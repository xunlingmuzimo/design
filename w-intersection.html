                <h2>Intersection- Guanzhong Wu& Pierre Soulages<span><br>Brand strategy &  Book making&nbsp; &nbsp;2017</span> </h2>


                <p class="passage">
                 This branding design of an exhibition is a group project that I've worked with my schoolmate Simon. As designers from different countries with distinctive cultures, we curated a hypothetic exhibition showing the works which integrated the elements from both the east and the west.         
<br><br>
INTERSECTION begins with the work of Guanzhong Wu and Pierre Soulages, master painters—Guanzhong from China, Soulages from France. Both born in 1919, each takes influence and stylistic cues from the culture of the other. Guanzhong, influenced by Fauvism and impressionist painters from the west, incorporated these styles into his work, rendering these new forms in Chinese calligraphic brush strokes and creating Chinese Modernism. Soulages incorporated the same brush stroke style and calligraphic influence from the east in his expressive, abstract paintings, and would later be regarded as one of the most influential painters of the century. The cultural intersection between the two and their expansion and elevation of calligraphic and impressionistic forms have broken formal restraints of the past and inspired an entire movement in contemporary art.
